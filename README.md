# Untitled Diaz Revamp Project

The project is an overhaul of [the last available Github version of Diaz](https://github.com/wildweasel486/ww-diaz-v3), utilizing assets and code from _[REDACTED]_. Much like _[REDACTED]_, our goal is to provide a high level of polish, quality, and gameplay feedback that builds on the original Diaz V3 version to meet the standards we've set for ourselves with [The Space Pirate](https://www.bluevertigo.org/thespacepirate) and other projects while honoring the legacy of the original release.
